0.000000,0,0.000000,=head1 DESCRIPTION
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,C<require EXPR> only accepts C<Class/Name.pm> style module names, not
0.000000,0,0.000000,C<Class::Name>. How frustrating! For that, we provide
0.000000,0,0.000000,C<load_class 'Class::Name'>.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,It's often useful to test whether a module can be loaded, instead of throwing
0.000000,0,0.000000,an error when it's not available. For that, we provide
0.000000,0,0.000000,C<try_load_class 'Class::Name'>.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,Finally, sometimes we need to know whether a particular class has been loaded.
0.000000,0,0.000000,Asking C<%INC> is an option, but that will miss inner packages and any class
0.000000,0,0.000000,for which the filename does not correspond to the package name. For that, we
0.000000,0,0.000000,provide C<is_class_loaded 'Class::Name'>.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,=head1 FUNCTIONS
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,=head2 load_class Class::Name, \%options
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,C<load_class> will load C<Class::Name> or throw an error, much like C<require>.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,If C<Class::Name> is already loaded (checked with C<is_class_loaded>) then it
0.000000,0,0.000000,will not try to load the class. This is useful when you have inner packages
0.000000,0,0.000000,which C<require> does not check.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,The C<%options> hash currently accepts one key, C<-version>. If you specify a
0.000000,0,0.000000,version, then this subroutine will call C<< Class::Name->VERSION(
0.000000,0,0.000000,$options{-version} ) >> internally, which will throw an error if the class's
0.000000,0,0.000000,version is not equal to or greater than the version you requested.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,This method will return the name of the class on success.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,=head2 try_load_class Class::Name, \%options -> (0|1, error message)
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,Returns 1 if the class was loaded, 0 if it was not. If the class was not
0.000000,0,0.000000,loaded, the error will be returned as a second return value in list context.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,Again, if C<Class::Name> is already loaded (checked with C<is_class_loaded>)
0.000000,0,0.000000,then it will not try to load the class. This is useful when you have inner
0.000000,0,0.000000,packages which C<require> does not check.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,Like C<load_class>, you can pass a C<-version> in C<%options>. If the version
0.000000,0,0.000000,is not sufficient, then this subroutine will return false.

0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,This uses a number of heuristics to determine if the class C<Class::Name> is
0.000000,0,0.000000,loaded. There heuristics were taken from L<Class::MOP>'s old pure-perl
0.000000,0,0.000000,implementation.

0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,This attempts to load the first loadable class in the list of classes
0.000000,0,0.000000,given. Each class name can be followed by an options hash reference.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,If any one of the classes loads and passes the optional version check, that
0.000000,0,0.000000,class name will be returned. If I<none> of the classes can be loaded (or none
0.000000,0,0.000000,pass their version check), then an error will be thrown.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,If, when attempting to load a class, it fails to load because of a syntax
0.000000,0,0.000000,error, then an error will be thrown immediately.

0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,C<load_optional_class> is a lot like C<try_load_class>, but also a lot like
0.000000,0,0.000000,C<load_class>.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,If the class exists, and it works, then it will return 1. If you specify a
0.000000,0,0.000000,version in C<%options>, then the version check must succeed or it will return
0.000000,0,0.000000,0.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,If the class doesn't exist, and it appears to not exist on disk either, it
0.000000,0,0.000000,will return 0.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,If the class exists on disk, but loading from disk results in an error
0.000000,0,0.000000,( i.e.: a syntax error ), then it will C<croak> with that error.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,This is useful for using if you want a fallback module system, i.e.:
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,my $class = load_optional_class($foo) ? $foo : $default;
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,That way, if $foo does exist, but can't be loaded due to error, you won't
0.000000,0,0.000000,get the behaviour of it simply not existing.
