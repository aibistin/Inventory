0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,This module allows you to manage a set of deprecations for one or more modules.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,When you import C<Package::DeprecationManager>, you must provide a set of
0.000000,0,0.000000,C<-deprecations> as a hash ref. The keys are "feature" names, and the values
0.000000,0,0.000000,are the version when that feature was deprecated.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,In many cases, you can simply use the fully qualified name of a subroutine or
0.000000,0,0.000000,method as the feature name. This works for cases where the whole subroutine is
0.000000,0,0.000000,deprecated. However, the feature names can be any string. This is useful if
0.000000,0,0.000000,you don't want to deprecate an entire subroutine, just a certain usage.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,You can also provide an optional array reference in the C<-ignore>
0.000000,0,0.000000,parameter.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,The values to be ignored can be package names or regular expressions (made
0.000000,0,0.000000,with C<qr//>).  Use this to ignore packages in your distribution that can
0.000000,0,0.000000,appear on the call stack when a deprecated feature is used.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,As part of the import process, C<Package::DeprecationManager> will export two
0.000000,0,0.000000,subroutines into its caller. It provides an C<import()> sub for the caller and a
0.000000,0,0.000000,C<deprecated()> sub.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,The C<import()> sub allows callers of I<your> class to specify an C<-api_version>
0.000000,0,0.000000,parameter. If this is supplied, then deprecation warnings are only issued for
0.000000,0,0.000000,deprecations for api versions earlier than the one specified.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,You must call the C<deprecated()> sub in each deprecated subroutine. When
0.000000,0,0.000000,called, it will issue a warning using C<Carp::cluck()>.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,The C<deprecated()> sub can be called in several ways. If you do not pass any
0.000000,0,0.000000,arguments, it will generate an appropriate warning message. If you pass a
0.000000,0,0.000000,single argument, this is used as the warning message.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,Finally, you can call it with named arguments. Currently, the only allowed
0.000000,0,0.000000,names are C<message> and C<feature>. The C<feature> argument should correspond
0.000000,0,0.000000,to the feature name passed in the C<-deprecations> hash.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,If you don't explicitly specify a feature, the C<deprecated()> sub uses
0.000000,0,0.000000,C<caller()> to identify its caller, using its fully qualified subroutine name.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,A given deprecation warning is only issued once for a given package. This
0.000000,0,0.000000,module tracks this based on both the feature name I<and> the error message
0.000000,0,0.000000,itself. This means that if you provide several different error messages for
0.000000,0,0.000000,the same feature, all of those errors will appear.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,=head1 BUGS
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,Please report any bugs or feature requests to
0.000000,0,0.000000,C<bug-package-deprecationmanager@rt.cpan.org>, or through the web interface at
0.000000,0,0.000000,L<http://rt.cpan.org>.  I will be notified, and then you'll automatically be
0.000000,0,0.000000,notified of progress on your bug as I make changes.

0.000000,0,0.000000,=head1 DONATIONS
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,If you'd like to thank me for the work I've done on this module, please
0.000000,0,0.000000,consider making a "donation" to me via PayPal. I spend a lot of free time
0.000000,0,0.000000,creating free software, and would appreciate any support you'd care to offer.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,Please note that B<I am not suggesting that you must do this> in order
0.000000,0,0.000000,for me to continue working on this particular software. I will
0.000000,0,0.000000,continue to do so, inasmuch as I have in the past, for as long as it
0.000000,0,0.000000,interests me.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,Similarly, a donation made in this way will probably not make me work on this
0.000000,0,0.000000,software much more, unless I get so many donations that I can consider working
0.000000,0,0.000000,on free software full time, which seems unlikely at best.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,To donate, log into PayPal and send money to autarch@urth.org or use the
