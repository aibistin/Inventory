0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,A C<SelectSaver> object contains a reference to the file handle that
0.000000,0,0.000000,was selected when it was created.  If its C<new> method gets an extra
0.000000,0,0.000000,parameter, then that parameter is selected; otherwise, the selected
0.000000,0,0.000000,file handle remains unchanged.
0.000000,0,0.000000,
0.000000,0,0.000000,When a C<SelectSaver> is destroyed, it re-selects the file handle
0.000000,0,0.000000,that was selected when it was created.
